                        <p class="font">Should a person be in a position to catch in many examples the scent of this
                            unhistorical
                            atmosphere, in which every great historical event arose, and to breathe it in, then such a
                            person might
                            perhaps be able, as a knowledgeable being, to elevate himself up to a superhistorical
                            standpoint, in
                            the way Niebuhr once described a possible result of historical research: "In one thing at
                            least," he
                            says, "is history, clearly and thoroughly grasped, useful, the fact that one knows, as even
                            the
                            greatest and highest spirits of our human race do not know, how their eyes have acquired by
                            chance the
                            way in which they see and the way in which they forcefully demand that everyone see,
                            forcefully
                            because
                            the intensity of their awareness is particularly great. Someone who has not, through many
                            examples,
                            precisely determined, known, and grasped this point is overthrown by the appearance of a
                            mighty
                            spirit
                            who in a given shape presents the highest form of passionate dedication."

                            We could call such a standpoint superhistorical, because a person who assumes such a stance
                            could feel
                            no more temptation to continue living and to participate in history. For he would have
                            recognized the
                            single condition of every event, that blindness and injustice in the soul of the man of
                            action.
                            He
                            himself would have been cured from now on of taking history excessively seriously. But in
                            the
                            process
                            he would have learned, for every person and for every experience, among the Greeks or
                            Turks,
                            from a
                            moment of the first or the nineteenth century, to answer for himself the question how and
                            why
                            they
                            conducted their lives. Anyone who asks his acquaintances whether they would like to live
                            through the
                            last ten or twenty years again will easily perceive which of them has been previously
                            educated
                            for that
                            superhistorical point of view. For they will probably all answer "No!", but they will
                            substantiate that
                            "No!" differently, some of them perhaps with the confident hope "But the next twenty years
                            will
                            be
                            better." Those are the ones of whom David Hume mockingly says:

                            And from the dregs of life hope to receive,
                            What the first sprightly running could not give.
